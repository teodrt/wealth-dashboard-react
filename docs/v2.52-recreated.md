# Wealth Dashboard v2.52 - Recreated

## Overview

This document describes the complete recreation of Wealth Dashboard v2.52, which was rebuilt from the ground up based on the specification after no artifacts could be recovered from Git history, source maps, or editor caches.

## What Was Recovered

### Recovery Process
- **Git History**: No dangling commits or lost work found
- **Source Maps**: No source maps containing original TypeScript/TSX files
- **Build Caches**: No traces of modern features in cache files
- **Editor History**: Not accessible programmatically
- **Other Clones**: No other local clones found

### Conclusion
The "version 2.52" that was seen live was never committed to Git or saved to files. It was likely a set of uncommitted local changes or modifications made during conversation that were not persisted.

## Features Implemented

### 8. Preflight System

- **Timestamp**: Build time information

### 10. Comprehensive Testing
- **Filter Tests**: URL sync, independent resets, defaults
- **Chart Tests**: Empty state handling, phantom bar fix
- **Component Tests**: Individual component behavior
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end functionality
