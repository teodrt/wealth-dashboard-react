# Recovery Notes

## Editor/Cursor History
- **Status**: Not accessible programmatically
- **Action**: Manual check required in Cursor's Timeline/File History
- **Files to check**: components/**, pages/**, app/**, workers/**, lib/**

## Source Maps
- **Status**: No source maps found
- **Result**: 0 files extracted
- **Action**: Proceed with spec-based implementation

## Git Recovery
- **Status**: No dangling commits found
- **Result**: All commits are reachable from HEAD
- **Action**: Proceed with spec-based implementation

## Next Steps
Since no artifacts were recovered from Git, source maps, or editor history, we must implement v2.52 from the specification.
