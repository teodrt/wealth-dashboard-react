## Recovery Status: NO ARTIFACTS FOUND

**Critical Finding**: No traces of v2.52 features were found in:
- Git history
- Source maps  
- Build caches
- Service workers
- Editor history (not accessible)

## Action Required
Since no artifacts were recovered, we must implement v2.52 from the specification. This confirms that the version you saw was never committed or saved to files.

## Next Steps
1. Implement v2.52 from specification
2. Create all required components (GlassCard, WallStreetTicker, NewsHub)
3. Implement multi-filters with independent resets
4. Add worker-based parsing with progress nudger
5. Create API routes for ticker and news
6. Add environment configuration and preflight scripts
7. Implement version banner and tests
